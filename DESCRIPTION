Description: This package is a collection of wrappers that extends Quantmod's 
  getSymbols functionality to use a variety of data sources. Quantmod contains
  a variety of wrappers already that can be used as is, however these are designed
  to be templates for extending your own custom data wrappers. This package provides
  a small sample of wrappers that I have found useful in retrieving certain types of
  data stored locally and through various third party data providers.
